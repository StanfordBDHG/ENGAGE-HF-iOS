[![Build and Test](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-iOS/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-iOS/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

This repository contains the ENGAGE-HF iOS application. ENGAGE-HF builds on top of the [Stanford Spezi Template Application](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication) using the [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi) ecosystem, and is primarily written using the [Swift](https://www.swift.org) programming language in conjunction with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/). The application is developed as part of the DOT-HF study. It records measurements taken on Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals (a weight scale and a blood pressure cuff), saves them to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), and generates medication recommendations based on recent vitals trends and KCCQ-12 survey responses. ENGAGE-HF also allows patients to interact with and manage their measurement history via a Heart Health page built with [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts).

## ENGAGE-HF Features

There are 6 main features of the app: a Home page with a dashboard that displays in-app messages and recent health vitals; a Heart Health page that allows the user to interact with and manage their health data; a Medications page that displays medication recommendations generated by the back-end algorithm; an Education page that features educational videos about the application, the study, and common heart failure medications; a sheet that displays a KCCQ-12 symptom survey; and a sophisticated Bluetooth implementation that allows the user to seamlessly pair bluetooth devices and record measurements without leaving the application.

The home page demonstrates that the application is server-driven, as the application displays messages that are generated on the backend. For ENGAGE-HF, this is a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs) based backend (for more information, see [ENGAGE-HF-Firebase](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-Firebase)). To help integrate the backend with our application, we use the standard [Firebase Firestore SDK as defined in the API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/add-data#swift) as well as [SpeziFirebase](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziFirebase).
