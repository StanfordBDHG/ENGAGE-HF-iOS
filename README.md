[![Build and Test](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-iOS/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/StanfordBDHG/ENGAGE-HF-iOS/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)

This repository contains the ENGAGE-HF iOS application. ENGAGE-HF builds on top of the [Stanford Spezi Template Application](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/SpeziTemplateApplication) using the [Spezi](https://github.com/StanfordSpezi/Spezi) ecosystem, and is primarily written using the [Swift](https://www.swift.org) programming language in conjunction with [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/). The application records measurements taken on Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals (a weight scale and a blood pressure cuff), saves them to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), and generates medication recommendations based on recent vitals trends and KCCQ12 survey responses. ENGAGE-HF also allows patients to interact with and manage their measurement history via a Heart Health page built with [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts).
